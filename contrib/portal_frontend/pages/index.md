# Welcome

Welcome to the developer portal. While our API may (or may not) offer a limited amount of anonymous requests, you will need an *API key* to use it properly. This portal is where you can generate API keys for your apps or websites. If you already have an account with us, sign in to the right. If you don't, sign up using the link at the top right or at the bottom of the sign-in box. 

### Our email policy

**By signing up, you agree to receive important service bulletins via email.**

We will email you about upcoming changes or outages that may affect you. We will **not** share your email with third parties, or send you anything that's not about your usage of our API.
